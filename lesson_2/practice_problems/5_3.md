The minimum width and height that the `div` needs to entirely contain the `em` element are:

First off, as `em` is an inline HTML element, the `height` and `width` properties of `em` are ignored.
Let's assume that  `em`'s content is going to span for 20 px height and 50 px width.

- Height: 50 px
  - Height (em): 20 px
  - Padding: 20 px
  - Borders (em): 8 px
  - Margins: 0 px (top and bottom margins are ignored for inline elements)
  - Borders (div): 2 px

-  Width: 130 px
  - Width (em): 50 px
  - Padding: 40 px
  - Border (em): 8 px
  - Margins: 30 px (29 right, 11 leFt)
  - Borders (div): 2 px
