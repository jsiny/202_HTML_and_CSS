The browser won't display the two `article` elements side-by-side 
because they're block-level elements by default, ie. they take
a row by themselves.

The first step is to properly define their `display` property:

```css
article { display: inline-block; }
```

But now, the two elements are still not displayed on the same line because they are too wide to fit within the `section`.

The following will solve it:

```css
article { box-sizing: border-box; }
```
